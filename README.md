Repository to demonstrate how to get started with the **[Data Science Research Infrastructure (DSRI)](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/dsri-documentation/)** using Python.

## Try the demo

Start **JupyterLab** from the template in the DSRI web UI catalog

Provide this repository URL when asked for a git repository to clone in the JupyterLab workspace, required packages will be automatically installed at the start of JupyterLab, from the `requirements.txt` and `packages.txt` files presents at the root of the repository.

### MySQL demo notebook

1. Start the **MySQL** database from the template in the **DSRI web UI catalog**
2. Access the JupyterLab web UI, and open the terminal
3. Run the `mysql.ipynb` notebook to load and query data in the MySQL database

### PostgreSQL demo notebook

1. Start the **PostgreSQL** database from the template in the **DSRI web UI catalog**
3. Access the JupyterLab web UI, and open the terminal
4. Run the `postgresql.ipynb` notebook to load and query data in the PostgreSQL database

### Long running script demo

Long running tasks cannot be run via the JupyterLab web UI, as the connection might be lost and JupyterLab is designed to visualize data, not run and manage long running tasks.

Multiple options are available, the easiest being to just run your jobs as a python script without the need to use any library (just copy/paste the codeblocks of the notebooks in a `.py` file)

Start the script via the terminal in detached mode (it will continue to run even if you close the terminal and the session):

```bash
nohup.out python script_get_data.py &
```

You can see the output generated by your python script in the file `nohup.out` in the folder where you started the script (instead of outputting directly to the terminal)

Use this command in the terminal to see if your script is still running:

```bash
ps aux
```

### Workflow demo

To do.

## Other demo repositories

MongoDB to be tested

1. `git clone https://github.com/pedrohserrano/twitter-covid-scam`
2. Download `json_covid.zip` (to be hosted somewhere, currently on a USB stick in Pedro's moving boxes)
3. Run `Dump2Mongo.ipynb`
4. Run `Analysis.ipynb`
